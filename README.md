# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design
**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The DriverPass project was created for a client named DriverPass, a company that wanted a system to help students prepare for their driver’s test. They wanted an online platform where users could take practice exams, access learning materials, and schedule in-person driving lessons with certified instructors. The system also needed admin features for managing users, lessons, vehicles, and reports.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I did particularly well on creating clear UML diagrams that showed how the system worked and how users interacted with it. I made sure each diagram was simple to read but still detailed enough to show the important connections between students, instructors, and administrators.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could revise one part of my work, I’d focus on improving the use case diagram. I’d organize it better and add more detail about how external systems, like the DMV or payment processor, connect to DriverPass

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

When designing the system, I paid close attention to what the client said they needed during the interview transcripts. The main focus was on creating something easy for students to use while also giving instructors and admins the tools they needed to manage lessons. Considering user needs is important because it keeps the design practical and ensures the system actually helps the people using it.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

When I design software, I start by breaking down what the system needs to do and mapping out how each part connects. I use techniques like UML diagrams, use cases, and user stories to plan out the structure and behavior. In the future, I’d like to use more Agile methods like iterative prototyping and regular feedback loops to make sure the design stays aligned with what users need.
